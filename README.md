# Docker Django Project Basics
A project that allows you to build an empty docker container with the read files mounted as  "volumes" so you can manipulate the website interactively.

The source of the project comes directly from  Very Academy (a youtube creator) and this specific setup comes from their video on the topic

- Docker
- Python
